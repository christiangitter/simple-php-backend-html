# Simple PHP-HTMl Backend

first you need to fill in your connection information in the helper.php
than you need to create a database with a table "content" ("ID", "Inhalt(Text)").

When everything is set up you can write Text in the fields of the backend.php.
The Text will be parsed to the DB and will appear on the index.php
